# The Viper EA MT5

The Viper EA MT5 is a mean reversion trading expert advisor developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. This expert advisor is designed to analyze market conditions and generate entry signals based on a mean reversion strategy. It also includes a trademark recovery mode to convert unsuccessful trades into profitable ones.

To use The Viper EA MT5, you need to include the necessary libraries `Trade.mqh` and `ArrayObj.mqh`. These libraries provide functions and classes for trading operations and array manipulation.

The main program is implemented in the `OnTick()` function, which is a built-in function in MetaTrader 5 that is called on every tick of the price data. Inside this function, the following steps are performed:

1. Mean Reversion Entries: The `MeanReversionEntries()` function is called to analyze market conditions and generate entry signals based on the mean reversion strategy. You can add your advanced algorithm in this function to customize the entry criteria.

2. Trademark Recovery Mode: The `TrademarkRecoveryMode()` function is called to analyze market conditions and convert unsuccessful trades into profitable ones. This function checks if potential losses are detected and adjusts trading parameters or executes additional trades to recover.

3. Integrate Live Results: The `IntegrateLiveResults()` function is called to integrate live results from previous expert advisors as a starting point for developing The Viper EA MT5. This function optimizes the code using 99.99% tick data on MT5 to ensure reliability and minimize over-optimization risks.

4. Stress Tests: The `StressTests()` function is called to conduct stress tests with multiple random settings for all supported pairs. These tests check the code stability and consistent performance. If the code passes all tests successfully, a message is printed indicating the success. Otherwise, a message is printed suggesting a review and necessary adjustments.
